# employee burnout analysis using Linear regression
This project focuses on analyzing employee burnout using a dataset containing features like designation, mental fatigue score, resource allocation, and more. The code involves data cleaning, handling missing values, and converting categorical variables using label encoding. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed with visualizations such as heatmaps and plots to understand feature relationships. Dimensionality reduction is applied using PCA to retain 95% variance, and a Linear Regression model is built to predict the burn rate. The model’s accuracy is evaluated using the R² score to assess how well workplace factors explain employee burnout.
