# employee burnout analysis using Linear regression
This project focuses on analyzing employee burnout using a real-world dataset that contains information such as designation, resource allocation, mental fatigue score, gender, company type, WFH setup availability, and burn rate. The analysis begins with loading and inspecting the data, followed by cleaning steps like handling missing values and converting dates to datetime format. Non-informative columns like Employee ID are dropped. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed through visualizations such as histograms, line plots, count plots, and a heatmap of correlations to understand feature distributions and relationships. Categorical variables are label-encoded, and selected features are passed through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality while retaining 95% of the data variance. A Linear Regression model is then trained on the PCA-transformed data to predict the Burn Rate, which serves as the target variable. The model’s performance is evaluated using the R² score. This workflow provides meaningful insights into factors contributing to employee burnout and demonstrates how PCA can improve model efficiency without significant loss of information.
